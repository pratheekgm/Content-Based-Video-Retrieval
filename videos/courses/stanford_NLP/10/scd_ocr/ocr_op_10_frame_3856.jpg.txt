Where did the name, dynamic
j programming, come from?

...The 19505 were not good years for mathematical research. [the] Secretary of
Defense ...had a pathological fear and hatred of the word. research...

I decided therefore to use the word, “programming".

I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic. this was multistage... I thought.
let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning. namely dynamic... it's
impossible to use the word. dynamic, in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some
combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible.

Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. it was something not even a
Congressman could object to."
