Computing alignments

 

- Edit distance isn’t sufﬁcient
- We often need to align each character of the two strings to each other

- We do this by keeping a "backtrace"
- Every time we enter a cell, remember where we came from

- When we reach the end,
- Trace back the path from the upper right corner to read off the alignment
