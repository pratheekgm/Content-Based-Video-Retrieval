in research and Opie these days that's always a lot of talk of probabilistic models in machine learning but if you actually look at large systems under the hood what you almost always find it so they also make quite a bit of using regular expressions in various places and Ferb Mini Toss it turns out the regular Expressions. Just a very practical and capable way of specifying various kinds of natural language patterns I'm going to show you one example of this now I show you how we use regular expressions for the English tokenizer inside the Stanford NLP tools such as deposit part of speech tagging on for the coronal piece weed over roll
okay hit me up with the code for the Stanford English took nyzzy so what it is is
Solage deterministic regular expression and so what is my name is with the tool called Jay Flex so long to a family of what is commonly called in computer science Alexa is which is just another word to tokenize as which would take a sequence of characters in Cut pieces One Toke move time off the front of it so there was the original Alexa spot of Unix and then flex and then this is Jay Flex which is a job a compatible version let's go down to wear some of the regular Expressions I used to define character classes
open what you find is that many of the regular Expressions on actually very complicated that they really nothing more than list of input into regular Expressions by putting those
pause in between 4th nation and soap refillable we see that in several places here so here we have one for abbreviated months and here we have one for abbreviated days of the week and that continues on to some of these other ones like American states and various other kinds of person named title acronyms down here but let's go on a little bit further the one that's a bit more interesting than that
 okay so he is one of phone numbers this is the kind of ill document in regular expression that's a little bit hard to actually hit your head around for the match used in practice at the very top level of this regular expression things and divided up
by this alternation right here and on the right hand side of the of nation there's a pattern with a separated who is being used as darts and so that once separated out as consistent use of dolts cuz otherwise it's easy for the regular expression to get a role in also recognize various kinds of decimal numbers and all the patterns and so that part of it is actually the easy apart so we can have at the beginning option way that you sir plus signs were too used in Europe and most of the rest of the world has us International prefix country cupboards and then we can have the country code he which is just numbers of the range to the full and then all of that is optional
 and then after that
got a first set of numbers which can be the area code the Doss than the second set of numbers which I guess it starts gives the exchange and then finally the third set of numbers answer these sets of numbers and then being given a link so this has to be between three and four numbers this has to be three and five numbers and the area code has to be too and phone numbers in size range is a chosen said that that work with the phone numbers of a bunch of the countries around the world but if you know what we were international phone numbers don't realize there are actually some cases that went still be recognized I'm by those then what then if we go to the left hand side of the regular expression it's effectively doing the same thing but this more complex
so that the first part of it is a game going to recognize things like optional country code so you can see the same piece over here
 I'm too comfy chair so you can actually sort of have some numbers that are put inside averitt parentheses and for the ball and we got this character class where we allowing a variety of other separate is apothem. So we can have a dash switch again needs to be escaped that can just be a space or they can be a nonbreaking space it is a Unicode Escape for non breaking space and so then over all this will allow to recognize a bunch
formats for phone numbers so don't recognize almost all American phone numbers in generator has pretty well with things like UK and Australian phone numbers don't example of where it doesn't work the normal phone number for mass in France did you just have pairs of digits with spaces in between them and us not included here and the difficulty is instead of writing a regular expression that matches that it's in the context of a deterministic regular expression matcha of managing to write one which was wonderful serve only match various other things such as numbers that just appearing as a sequence of numbers to some of the reason
well I hope that's giving you some idea of the use of regular expressions in NOP systems around another man o p systems I'm sure you'll find lots of other examples
commonly when people want to match particular patterns when they be patterns of the level of words or patterns of the level of parts of speech they can just be very convenient and practical methods to solve many practical tasks
