once we've segmented out words or tokenize them we need to normalize them and stem them so normalizing means different things for information retrieval for example we require that the index tax in the query terms have to have the same forms we want to match U. S. A. To USA if somebody asks a question or a query with one of them and the answer has the other we want them to match so it's like implicitly defining some kind of equivalence class of terms
we might do this by always deleting. For example in my pic they have a rule that takes you. Ask that ETA to USA I'm an alternative is some kind of asymmetric expansion so for example let's say it's we're doing information retrieval if I enter the term window
I might want to search for window or window is there any any any morphological variant of the word window but if I enter capital W Windows I might only want to search for capital W Windows cuz the person is presently looking for the product and not the part of your house
 I'm in this is a potentially more powerful algorithm but less efficient than much more complicated so in general we use symmetric and relatively simple expansions so for example in information retrieval we generally remove produce all letters to lowercase since users tend to use lower case with some small exception so for example if we see uppercase in the middle of a sentence like General Motors we might want to keep the case in this matter is for distinguishing and the verb fed from the Federal
translate all of the uppercase to lowercase will dealing with a combining all the uppercase and lowercase words and now it's crap out for around finding any line that contains a regular expression in a file very useful Unix program so we're going to look for the regular expression ing dollar sign and them so we'll find all words ending in ing and let's sort them and then we'll just take one copy of each and count them and then sort them by the counts and see what words we find ending in ing in Shakespeare and what we see is lots of these words are not words that in fact we would like to to m
 to remove the ing from soap
words like King and nothing and sing and ring and something and sing and them anything and spring so this is this is this is been a lot of words what a big freaking words in fact that it would be a bad idea to remove the ing remove the 90 from King weed and so on mood I N G from Spring we get spread so what modifier rule
 that we did instead of saying grabbing for all words ending in ing let's just go back and change that to grab for all words with a vowel will just make it be aeiou simulator of goggles with Stolen Valor letters
 and we need some way to save as a vowel and anything can happen in between followed by the ing what what's how do we say anything.
character * meaning 0 more of those and now it's look at and at what words we get back from that pattern
 and now to be specified at the word has to start with a vowel you've done a much better job of finding two syllable words were the ancient package supposed to be stripped off so there's still some problematic words like nothing in something we don't want to get enough and some of them and anything but otherwise I am not coming but otherwise we done a pretty good job of making the rule a little bit better so there's a little explanation of how the porter stemmer works and then how we can actually eat use are eunuchs tools to do a little Corpus Linguistics 2 m to help write rules on this kind
 so that's a Sim
example of morphology it turns out that in some language is much more complex morphology is necessary and Turkish is the famous example of this so here's a word in Turkish which I will be able to pronounce for you I'm which means behaving as if you are among those whom we could not civilize so I assume it's the kind of thing your mother says to you when when you've been particularly naughty and in Turkish this is one word so it's a very long word with a lot of them stems we have the Civilized stem and an ethics mean to become an Ethics meeting cause and I'm not able and so on and so in languages like Turkish and as we saw earlier for the very long nouns in German we're going to have to do a richer and more complex morphine segmentation
 Trisomy 18
which organization and now we've seen that words will have to be normalized and stems to make them to a normal form
bank with a capital f m or a group like I'm sail the Stanford artificial-intelligence lab from the verb sale and it turns out that for sentiment analysis or machine translation or information extraction cases in fact very helpful it was a big difference between us at the US
 we also often want to do lemon ization so we're reducing are inflections or variant forms to their base form so words like a mandar and his will get lemmatized in to be car car car apostrophe s and so on get limit size two car so a phrase like the boys cars are different colors should get Lemon Thai sub boy car be different color so in general the task of limitation is finding the correct dictionary head word formed for
word form that you're given and of course is very important for all sorts of applications for tickling machine translations wear for example if you have a Spanish verb like yet oh I want or kid is you want you it's very important to know that this is the same Lema escudilla the verb to want to this General topic of looking at parts of words leads us to morphology morphology is the study of morphemes in a morpheme is the smallest unit that makes up a word we usually distinguish two kinds of morphemes stems that's the core meaning bearing units time in a word and affixes ethics is the bits and pieces that adhere to the stem off and they have grammatical functions
 so on this particular slide in
stem is a stem and ass is an affix the word affix it to confuse us is a stem and their es is the affix so there is no fix this mess and their ass and meaningful is another ethics and so on
 so stemming is the task of taking off these offices to reduce terms to their stem and it's particularly historically derive from information-retrieval although it's used in all sorts of applications
 we use the word stemming when we specifically mean a kind of a crew chopping off of a bath x's and this is of course a language dependent kind of process so the English word automate automate automatic otamatone we like them all to her
are the same stem automat so stemming is like a simplified version of lemon ization or we pick up a prefix of the word use that to represent the word and we chop off all the suffixes that are relevant leading to that stem
 here's an example little text for example compressed and compression are both accepted is equivalent to compress that's the text and if we stemmed that text here's the resulting output so you can see that and that we've lost the Eon example and compressed and compressing have both turned into compressed and here we used our we could have used to be as a representation of our example we used our and so on
 the simplest
most commonly used one for simple standing of English is the porter algorithm
 in the port is algorithm is a series of an iterated series of simple rules simple replace rules so I'm free example one set of rules sterile step one na take strings like s s e s and replaces them with SS so in a world like caresses it shops off the es of caresses or rule that takes IES to I chops off the is a ponies and leaves Pony we're going to use Pony with an I come as a representation in Porter stemming of Pony and the rules operate in order so that I'm at this point if there's any SS is left they stay as an s
the other s's get deleted at this point to the S of cats is deleted while the SS of caress is kept
 similarly in Step 1 B we might we remove all of the things in the ad so we want to cross off the ink of walk and the Ed of plastered but we specify the rule very carefully that the porter stemmer only words without a vowel
 get their emails remove nuts because of word like sing only words it was a vet in additional Val before the game so weird like seeing which has no extra vowels and only has one Bala Bala ning. Stays a sing but walking which has a vowel and in addition a eval before the aim is allowed to delete the suffix so if a word
has a vowel followed by eating the English deleted and lots of other sexual Soap Channel turns into 8 so we can cross off the Hall of relational and the Sun and end up with relate and eyes are two eyes and sweet. The are and so on
 and the Rose get even more complicated so as you get to very long stems you going to remove it all all of Revival in The Other Boleyn and so on
 let's look again at this rule that strips in and practice using the Unix tools that we saw in the last section to look and morphology in a corpus so remember why we stripping the aims only if there's a vowel preceding the end it was the rule
remember we said that I'm in a weird like walking we have a vowel before the aim and so it's okay to remove the Yang in a word like saying there is no vowel before there's no letters at all before they ask there's no previous fouls and so sing the rule doesn't apply
 and let's do a little and
 search for words ending in ink in Shakespeare so we're going to first take all of Shakespeare and turn all the non alphabetic characters
 oops
 turn all the knowledge of both characters into new lines are going to get one word per line then we're going to
